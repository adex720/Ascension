## Overall thoughts on ascension <a name="thoughts"></a>

Currently the game already has two forms of progression: rebirths and prestiges. I haven't had long term problems with low motivation yet am at almost prestige 400. Some altrenatives would be good, but they can be other forms as "enchaned prestige". A good example of this is the recent feature farming.

One of the most important things is that it shouldn't be mandatory. With a hundred players past prestige 300, it is almsot impossible to get all of them feel like it's worth it. At least if the ascensions are wanted to be kept in a stage where calling them balanced is understandable.
Another point is that if implemented well many old players can get motivation back.

The most obivious one is that only small portion of the playerbase is going to reach it. Is it really worth it spend multiple months on a feature which only the most hardcore players will reach? The bot has done well for years even without feature like this, and is popular among newbies and older players.
