## Overall thoughts on ascension <a name="about"></a>

This feedback is split into 3 different groups.
First group contains arguments for which style to choose or to not implement it at all. Each of them contains arguments both as overall and in three different perspectives: **low**, **middle** and **high** prestige players.
- Low prestige is relevant for people under prestige 100.
- Middle prestige is relevant for people between prestiges 100 and 400.
- High prestige is relevant for people past prestige 300.

The second group contains opinions from several players each player having their own feedback.

The third group has suggestion separated for consepts A and B.




## Notes<a name="notes"></a>

One of the most important things is that it shouldn't be mandatory. With a hundred players past prestige 250, it is almsot impossible to get all of them feel like it's worth it. At least if the ascensions are wanted to be kept in a stage where calling them balanced is understandable.
People can also feel that their freedom is limit if they are forced to ascend to stay a top player or on the leaderboards.
You must still take in count that if implemented well, many old players can get motivation back.

This doesn't contain opnions from everyone and the result can be different that what people not in this think.

We assume that you have already thought a lot about making it worth, so this mostly tries to includ things that multiple people find important and suggestions how to make it good. It is still very likely that bunch of stuff listed here is alreasy thought by you.

## Reasons to not add ascensions <a name="no-implement"></a>

The most obivious one is that only small portion of the playerbase is going to reach it. Is it really worth it spend multiple months on a feature which only the most hardcore players will reach? Would it be more effective to just focus on smaller updates or features affecting majority of active people like fishing?
The bot has done well for years even without feature like this, and is popular among newbies and older players.

### From the perspective of high prestige player <a name="no-implement-high"></a>
- Progress can be feel like lost if a prestige 1k player will start with similar stats as one who just met the requirements.
- The rewards for going for very high prestiges would be so good that people would just continue grinding for better rewards instead of ascending.

### From the perspective of middle prestige player <a name="no-implement-middle"></a>
- The late prestigeshop perks feel unreachable and pointless.

### From the perspective of low prestige player <a name="no-implement-low"></a>
- Only few people who play will reach ascensions. Time can be spent on features that affect everyone.

## Reasons to add ascension concept A <a name="concept-a"></a>
Concept A is less work than B. It is also easier to understand.
Ascensions will become significantly easier the more you have them matching the way of rebiths and prestiges.

### From the perspective of high prestige player <a name="concept-a-high"></a>
- High prestige players will get op buffs.
- The benifit of having large prestige count boosts immiaditely.

### From the perspective of middle prestige player <a name="concept-a-middle"></a>

### From the perspective of low prestige player <a name="concept-a-low"></a>


## Reasons to add ascension concept B <a name="concept-b"></a>
The first ascension is reached earlier making more players affected by it. This seems to be less repeative making the bot less repeative too.
Ascensions won't become fast.

### From the perspective of high prestige player <a name="concept-b-high"></a>
- Players don't lose anything from ascending at higher prestiges in the long run.
    
### From the perspective of middle prestige player <a name="concept-b-middle"></a>
    
### From the perspective of low prestige player <a name="concept-b-low"></a>
- The feature is way easier to get into.


## Opinions from several people <a name="opinion"></a>

### ADEX##2242 (Prestige 379) <a name="opinion-adex"></a>:
I haven't had long term problems with low motivation yet am at almost prestige 400. Some altrenatives would be good, but they can be other forms as "enchaned prestige".
I personally get more motivation from frequent smaller updates then from seldom big changes. Farming has given me a lot motivation, mostly from being high on the leaderboard, but also at the start, from exploring the new mechanics.
I hope that if ascensions will become a thing, they would have new things to explore and sample with.



## Ideas for ascension concept A <a name="ideas-a"></a>

Ideas for hero abilities:
- **More prestige coins**: It could be either a multiplier or an addition. This would make the late shop features more accessible and make it feel different when you get this hero.
- **Credits**: If want to keep credits donor exclusive don't add this
- **Time traveller 2**: More chance for time traveller
- **More crystals**: Self explanatory
